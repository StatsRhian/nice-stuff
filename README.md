# Nice Stuff :sparkles:

Just a collection of nice feedback I have had over the years.


## Training

> I enjoyed every minute of the course. The presenter has great teaching skills.


> Rhian was very good. Very knowledgeable and good sense of humour. Eager to go off on tangents to demonstrate other little programming gems - a sign of someone who really knows their stuff and enjoys it! That comes across very clearly.


> Rhian was really open to questions, and was great at responding to these.


> Rhian's ability to explain the nuts and bolts of how a function worked.


> Thank you so much for the excellent course, Rhian. Youâ€™re a brilliant educator!


> Thank you Rhian for an excellent session once again! Really good teaching wish I had the same 35 years ago!!


> Rhian made the course seem informal and incredibly approachable, she made a few jokes which lightened the tone and made me feel relaxed so that I felt more comfortable getting involved with the tasks etc.


> Rhian explained things very clearly. She helped me to understand some basics that I hadn't grasped in the earlier courses. I particularly liked that she showed how to look things up and that not knowing things off the top of your head wasn't a failure. Clearly being new to R we will have to look up a lot of things so it was good to do this in the practice, and to see an expert doing it too!


> Sometimes plotting our data/results is something that we HAVE TO do, but I've just discovered how fun it can be. Rhian was a great teacher and gave us also many external resources to get ideas and improve our skills


> Rhian was very knowledgeable, and very good at explaining things


> Rhian was an excellent instructor, very clear explanations, quick, responsive and knowledgeable.


> Rhian was a brilliant teacher.


> Rhian was an excellent trainer - enthusiastic, engaging and knowledgeable.
