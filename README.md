# Nice Stuff :sparkles:

Just a collection of nice feedback I have had over the years.

## As a line manager

>  I haven't forgotten the kindness and patience you showed me as I tried and failed to adjust to the role. It was a difficult time for me, at and away from work, and your daily support was a lifeline when I really needed one.

## As a colleague

> I really value how you can get to the root of issues and bring clarity to discussions
> 
> I always find you bring such a good perspective on difficult topics
> 
> You have a really nice manner in facilitation
 
## Presentations

> I was thoroughly impressed by the insightful talks you gave during the conference; they were both engaging and informative, definitely some of my favorite talks in this conference.  (RSS attendee 2023)

## Client work

> Just wanted to drop you a note to say thanks very much for setting up the shiny application so smoothly, effectively and responsively! It wasn’t an easy ask with some challenging timescales and changing requirements, but you were super flexible and very quick to understand what we needed and be clear on the options.

> Rhian did an unbelievable job in challenging circumstances

## Training

> I enjoyed every minute of the course. The presenter has great teaching skills.


> Rhian was very good. Very knowledgeable and good sense of humour. Eager to go off on tangents to demonstrate other little programming gems - a sign of someone who really knows their stuff and enjoys it! That comes across very clearly.


> Rhian was really open to questions, and was great at responding to these.


> Rhian's ability to explain the nuts and bolts of how a function worked.


> Thank you so much for the excellent course, Rhian. You’re a brilliant educator!


> Thank you Rhian for an excellent session once again! Really good teaching wish I had the same 35 years ago!!


> Rhian made the course seem informal and incredibly approachable, she made a few jokes which lightened the tone and made me feel relaxed so that I felt more comfortable getting involved with the tasks etc.


> Rhian explained things very clearly. She helped me to understand some basics that I hadn't grasped in the earlier courses. I particularly liked that she showed how to look things up and that not knowing things off the top of your head wasn't a failure. Clearly being new to R we will have to look up a lot of things so it was good to do this in the practice, and to see an expert doing it too!


> Sometimes plotting our data/results is something that we HAVE TO do, but I've just discovered how fun it can be. Rhian was a great teacher and gave us also many external resources to get ideas and improve our skills

> We universally loved the format and delivery from Rhian; the regular and useful breaks are well timed and help with fatigue and the totally interactive nature of the teaching made the content easy to understand and the two afternoons fly by, without feeling stressed but still feeling there was valuable learning. In short an excellent format and presenter!

> Rhian was very knowledgeable, and very good at explaining things

> You are great at explaining things simply!

> Rhian was an excellent instructor, very clear explanations, quick, responsive and knowledgeable.


> Rhian was a brilliant teacher.

> thank you it's been really useful and informative i feel like i understand the theory of things a bit more than i did at undergrad (Statistical modelling course)

> Rhian was an excellent trainer - enthusiastic, engaging and knowledgeable.
