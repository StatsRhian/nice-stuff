# Nice Stuff :sparkles:

Just a collection of nice feedback I have had over the years.

## Presentations

> I was thoroughly impressed by the insightful talks you gave during the conference; they were both engaging and informative, definitely some of my favorite talks in this conference.  (RSS attendee 2023)

## Training

> I enjoyed every minute of the course. The presenter has great teaching skills.


> Rhian was very good. Very knowledgeable and good sense of humour. Eager to go off on tangents to demonstrate other little programming gems - a sign of someone who really knows their stuff and enjoys it! That comes across very clearly.


> Rhian was really open to questions, and was great at responding to these.


> Rhian's ability to explain the nuts and bolts of how a function worked.


> Thank you so much for the excellent course, Rhian. Youâ€™re a brilliant educator!


> Thank you Rhian for an excellent session once again! Really good teaching wish I had the same 35 years ago!!


> Rhian made the course seem informal and incredibly approachable, she made a few jokes which lightened the tone and made me feel relaxed so that I felt more comfortable getting involved with the tasks etc.


> Rhian explained things very clearly. She helped me to understand some basics that I hadn't grasped in the earlier courses. I particularly liked that she showed how to look things up and that not knowing things off the top of your head wasn't a failure. Clearly being new to R we will have to look up a lot of things so it was good to do this in the practice, and to see an expert doing it too!


> Sometimes plotting our data/results is something that we HAVE TO do, but I've just discovered how fun it can be. Rhian was a great teacher and gave us also many external resources to get ideas and improve our skills

> We universally loved the format and delivery from Rhian; the regular and useful breaks are well timed and help with fatigue and the totally interactive nature of the teaching made the content easy to understand and the two afternoons fly by, without feeling stressed but still feeling there was valuable learning. In short an excellent format and presenter!
